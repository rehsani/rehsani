						<h3>New NASA funded flood mapping efforts</h3>
						<span class="image right"><img src="images/Satellite_signed.jpg" alt="" /></span>

						
							<h4>NASA Commercial SmallSat Data Analysis. 20-CSDA20-0121. 2021-22. PI with collaborators Iskha Gurung, Andrew Molthan (NASA), Kobus Barnard, and Upmanu Lall. High resolution imagery to train and validate deep learning models of inundation extent for multiple satellite sensors</h4>
						<p>
							Our dataset, called FloodPlanet, will include 25 major flood events, labeled with co-located Planet, Maxar, HLS (Harmonized Sentinel-2 and Landsat), and Sentinel-1 data to promote cross-sensor fusion across public and commercial sensors and deep learning modeling efforts in the remote sensing and computer vision fields. We will develop our own deep learning models for high resolution urban flood detection, and release the the high quality benchmark dataset we will produce in this proposal.
						</p>
						<h4>NASA New Early Career Investigators Program Earth Sciences. 20-NIP20-0224. 2021-2024. PI with Collaborators Upmanu Lall, Saiful Islam, Mohammed Bhuyan, Mehadi Hasan, and Sarder Raihan. Understanding flood risk in human altered landscapes from cities to farms: inferences from satellites and machine learning</h4>
						<p>
							This project leverages inundation observations to understand extreme flood risk in human-modified landscapes, specifically in urban and agricultural areas in Bangladesh. We will use commercial and public sensors to i) map maximum inundated area for extreme flood events, ii) quantify flood risk at watershed scales, and iii) estimate of flood return periods at household scales (30m resolution). These objectives will be reached by using deep learning approaches to map floods and damage, and estiamte return periods with Bayesian Hierarchical Models. We will use optical and radar satellites, including MODIS, Sentinel-1, Planetscope, and the HLS (Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 dataset), comparing satellite-based flood maps and return period predictions for Bangladesh to those produced by the Bangladesh Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (from a physically-based model). We will discuss applications for insurance and climate risk financing with collaborators in Bangladesh.
						</p>

						<h4>NASA Terrestrial Hydrology. 19-THP19-0042. 2021-2024. PI with Co-Is Upmanu Lall, Pierre Gentine, and Venkat Lakshmi. Mapping flood impacts using multi-sensor satellite data fusion in urban areas</h4>

							<p>
								In this research, we are developing novel sensor fusion techniques to take advantage of the expanding availability of sensors with different spatial and temporal resolutions to monitor urban flooding. To do so, we combine public optical (MODIS, Landsat, Sentinel-2), radar (Sentinel-1), passive microwave (AMSR, SMAP) imagery and commercial data from PlanetScope with the eventual goal of generating 30-meter per-pixel probabilities of inundation in urban areas globally every 3 days.

					<h3>Illicit activity and land change: Narcotrafficking in Central America</h3>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/deforestation_Nica.jpg" alt="" /></span> Illicit economic activity shapes land use around the world, but inadequate data makes it difficult to quantify relationships. We've developed methods to leverage news media and satellite data to study how illicit activity shapes landscapes in Central America, the region where the vast majority of cocaine that arrives in the USA travels through. As the US war on drugs attempts to 
								(unsuccessfully) intercept drug traffickers, they move into remote forested regions. This arrival of drugs, and the capital that comes with it, causes changes in land cover, use, ownership, and control with adverse
								impacts on people, forests, and biodiveristy in Central America. In collaboration with a larger research team, we seek to better understand how narcotrafficking transforms landscapes and what policies could reduce violence and support sustainable development in the region.
								See <a href="https://beth-tellman.github.io/opportunities.html"> opportunities</a> for our recent <a href="https://lcluc.umd.edu/projects/making-hidden-visible-accelerated-land-use-change-and-degradation-caused-narco-trafficking"> NASA grant</a> to continue this work.

				<h3>Informal urbanization: Mexico City</h3>

							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/xochifamer.jpg" alt="" /></span>Urban expansion is growing fast in the Global South, much of which occured on land unplanned for formal urban development. 
								Informal urban settlements provide needed housing for growing populations, with subsequent needs for services like water, electricity, and property titles. 
						We've been studying what (and who!) governs informal urban expansion in Mexico City, and the social and environmental consequences.</p>

					<h3> Infrastructure, water vulnerability, and adaptation: Rainwater Harvesting in Mexico City</h3>

							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/oxfam_study.png" alt="" /></span> As megacities grow, infrastructure choices may either reduce or further entrench vulnerability to water security. One decentralized adaptation to water stress is household rainwater harvesting, which can improve water access in the rainy season.
								We worked with Isla Urbana, an NGO in Mexico City, to estimate how their harvesting system could improve water security across the city if implemented on every home. Oxfam funded a study for us to build a large geospatial model 
								to integrate satellite imagery, census data, climate data, and surveys to identify the neighborhoods where rainwater harvesting systems would reduce water stress and how many systems should be installed. The <a href="https://www.oxfammexico.org/sites/default/files/Captacion%20de%20agua%20en%20la%20CDMX.pdf">study</a> was 
								the basis for the city government's plan to stall 100,000 systems where we indicate they could most improve water access.

							<h3>Flood Insurance: Bangladesh</h3>

							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Sen2_Bangladesh.png" alt="" /></span> With Columbia's International Research Institute for Climate and Society, we are developing methods and datasets to support innovative insurance
								programs in Bangaldesh, one of the most flood vulnerable countries in the world. Our datasets are based on multiple satellite sensors (MODIS, Sentinel-1, and SSMI).
								We use Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to extract flood damage data from news media articles to validate our satellite based inundated area time series. We are working with the Bangladesh Flood Forecasting and Warning Center, Oxfam, IMWI, and other partners in this project.
								We were recently award a NASA New Investigator's award to continue working on this project until 2023! See <a href="https://beth-tellman.github.io/opportunities.html"> opportunities </a> to get involved and for more details.

								Umbela is an organización whose objective is to foster transformation of the planet towards sustainability, 
								through innovative processes that generate spaces of collaboration to articule diverse knowledges, cultures, 
								and foci that contribute to the development and implemention of conditions of well being, justice, and equality in society and in the environment.
									Our objectives include: </p>
							<p>
-	To give voice to groups and marginalized voices that find themselves in situations of environmental conflict.								
							</p>
								<p>
								-	To strengthen capacities of different actors in society through tools of adaptive collaboration, inclusion, and plurality.
								
							</p>
							<p>
-	To look for innovative  and collaborative solutions with the objective of contributing to social well being and global environmental integrity.								
							</p>
							<p>
-	To promote transdiscplinary processes that transcend discplines, institutions, and hierarchies to co-construct visions and decisions that detonate roads of transformation towards sustainability.							</p>
	<p>
	-	To construct alliances, and spaces of dialogue and collaboration through contiunous involvement.
	</p>
	<p>
		Website and viritual launch of Umbela coming soon!!
