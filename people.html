								<h4>Hannah Friedrich</h4>
								<p>PhD Student</p>
							</header>
							<p>Hannah will be starting as a PhD Student in Geography at the University of Arizona in Fall 2021. Hannah completed a Bachelor’s in Geography and GIS/Cartography from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a Master’s in Geography at Oregon State University within the <a href="https://www.conflict-ecology.org/about">Conflict Ecology Lab</a>. During and following her Master’s, she worked on the NASA Applied Sciences-funded Mapping the Missing Millions project, where she studied land cover change dynamics of refugee settlement establishment and growth in Northern Uganda. Hannah’s research interests are in applying remote sensing insights to human displacement and resettlement response efforts. During her PhD, Hannah aims to her expand her use of spatial data to study the effects of flooding on urban informal settlements to develop climate risk-sensitive approaches for informal settlement planning and displacement prevention.  <br>

								<h4>Rohit Mukherjee</h4>
								<p>PostDoc</p>
							</header>
							<p>Rohit will start as a postdoc in June 2021 at the Tellman Lab. He completed his Bachelor's (Computer Science) and Master's (Remote Sensing and GIS) in India. Rohit worked in the software industry for a brief period before pursuing his Ph.D. at the Ohio State University (Advisor - Dr. Desheng Liu). In his doctoral research, he applied deep learning to improve the spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions of publicly available satellite datasets. He is interested in leveraging the different perspectives offered by various satellite data sources to improve our understanding of our impact on the environment. Rohit's post-doctoral research will involve mapping floods in urban areas and detecting illicit land changes in protected areas. Besides research, he loves to read and play/follow soccer. <br>
